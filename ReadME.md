run_analysis.RDescription: Contains the averages of the mean and standard deviation of accelerometer and gyroscope readings for each data point of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set (see http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) compiled according to subject by activity.The data was compiled using the run_analysis.R script. It was generated from the testing and training dataset housed at the Human Activity Recognitions website (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).Requirements----------------Packages: The script requires the dplyr package.Data: The data must be unzipped and stored in the working directory. The training data should be stored in a folder "train" and the testing data should be stored in a folder called "testing". The following files are required within the working directory."test/subject_test.txt"                       "test/X_test.txt"                             "test/y_test.txt""train/subject_train.txt"                     "train/X_train.txt"                           "train/y_train.txt"Description of  Routine----------------------------1) All training data is compiled into a single frame2) All testing data is compiled into a single data frame3) The training and testing data are compiled into a single dataset4) Descriptive labels for the activities are applied to replace the activity codes5) The variables related to the mean and standard deviation of each measure (at each data point) are extracted from the complete data along with the session indicator (training vs testing), subjected, and activity (descriptive label)6) New variable names are applied to the measures to offer their description7) The data is grouped by subjectID and activity8) Summarize is used to return the mean of the selected measures/readings at each data point (compiled by subjectID x activity.... Yields up to six data points/rows per subjectID)9) Data is written out to a table in meanData.txtOutput: meanData.txtVariables:	subjectID = ID for the subject assigned by the experimenter	activity = Activity being performed by the subject when the reading was taken	mean of readings for each subject x activity	---------------------------		tBodyGyro_mean_Z		tBodyGyro_std_X		tBodyGyro_std_Y		tBodyGyro_std_Z		tBodyGyroJerk_mean_X		tBodyGyroJerk_mean_Y		tBodyGyroJerk_mean_Z		tBodyGyroJerk_std_X		tBodyGyroJerk_std_Y		tBodyGyroJerk_std_Z		tBodyAccMag_mean		tBodyAccMag_std		tGravityAccMag_mean		tGravityAccMag_std		tBodyAccJerkMag_mean		tBodyAccJerkMag_std		tBodyGyroMag_mean		tBodyGyroMag_std		tBodyGyroJerkMag_mean		tBodyGyroJerkMag_std		fBodyAcc_mean_X		fBodyAcc_mean_Y		fBodyAcc_mean_Z		fBodyAcc_std_X		fBodyAcc_std_Y		fBodyAcc_std_Z		fBodyAccJerk_mean_X		fBodyAccJerk_mean_Y		fBodyAccJerk_mean_Z		fBodyAccJerk_std_X		fBodyAccJerk_std_Y		fBodyAccJerk_std_Z		fBodyGyro_mean_X		fBodyGyro_mean_Y		fBodyGyro_mean_Z		fBodyGyro_std_X		fBodyGyro_std_Y		fBodyGyro_std_Z		fBodyAccMag_mean		fBodyAccMag_std		fBodyBodyAccJerkMag_mean		fBodyBodyAccJerkMag_std		fBodyBodyGyroMag_mean		fBodyBodyGyroMag_std		fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag_mean		fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag_std
